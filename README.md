StarUML helps programmers and software engineers to understand programming components at a glance. It creates a visual representation of different units of code and displays different types of relations between components. Similar apps include ArgoUML and Diagram Designer.

StarUML is a software modelling tool that supports UML (Unified Modelling Language) and UML2 frameworks, which are standardised methods of representing software components and their relations. Software engineers can use StarUML to understand software systems through visualised relationships between software components.

What is StarUML used for?
StarUML is particularly useful for getting new developers up to speed on projects and for designing new projects from scratch. The visual nature of these models makes it much easier to understand than the alternative of having to read and grasp potentially hundreds of thousands of lines of code to understand a new system.

Is StarUML open source?
StarUML is open source, meaning that its source code is freely available to inspect and modify. However, a software license must be purchased for those who wish to use the product for commercial or educational purposes.

Build and learn software architecture faster
StarUML is an excellent way to teach and understand software systems. This is useful both for students and professionals who are looking to teach, understand or design new software architecture. In addition to UML, it also supports SysML, ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagrams), DFD (Data-Flow Diagrams), Flowchart diagrams and plenty more.

The powerful tools provided by StarUML follow the industry-standard UML language, meaning that any developer familiar with UML can pick up and start using StarUML relatively quickly. In addition to this, an extension manager allows for additional third-party components to be installed. It is not beginner-friendly software, but its target market is very specific and for those that it is aimed at, it is a powerful tool.
